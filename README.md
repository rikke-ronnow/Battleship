# Battleship

## Intro

This repository contains code which is used to run a game of Battleship. It also contains a probabilistic strategy and a reinforcement learning strategy, which can be passed as arguments to the function which runs the game.

Battleship is a popular game around the world in which two players place their “battleships” at positions in a lattice unknown to the opposing player. They then take turns guessing the location of their opponent's ship, if they guess correctly they have “hit” their opponent's ship and if they ‘hit’ all the parts of a ship then the ship is ‘sunk’. The player who sinks all their opponent’s ships first wins.
